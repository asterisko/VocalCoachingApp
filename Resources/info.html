<p class="p1"><b>How MasterPitch works</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>MasterPitch</b> is a fluency enhancer device designed to help reducing stuttering. <b>MasterPitch</b> modifies the natural mouth-to-ear acoustic feedback such as to replicate the “chorus effect”. This effect is observed when a stutterer sings in a chorus or speaks in unison with a second speaker, under which circumstances stuttering is virtually eliminated or strongly reduced.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>MasterPitch alters the acoustic feedback in two ways:</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Delayed Altered Feedback (DAF)</b>: the voice sound reaches the ears later than the natural acoustic feedback; the delay can be adjusted between 40 milliseconds and 500 milliseconds,</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Frequency Altered Feedback (FAF): </b>the voice sound is modified in pitch before reaching the ears, as if a different person was speaking, or the same person but younger or older. The pitch can be modified between an octave below and an octave above, in intervals of 0.1 semitone.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">In order to provide effective Altered Feedback, MasterPitch requires the use of hearphones inside-the-ear, or covering the ears, such as to make the Altered FeedBack more audible than the natural acoustic feedback.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Unique features of MasterPitch</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">MasterPitch has a unique feature allowing <b>FAF</b> to be chosen from two alternatives: Basic and TrueVoice. TrueVoice consists of a patent-pending algorithm allowing to preserve the idiosyncrasies of the voice when the pitch is altered. The resulting voice quality gives the comfortable sensation that the speaker is either younger or older.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">For comfortable listening in noisy environments, MasterPitch provides a Noise Gate functionality which, if selected, virtually eliminates the disturbance caused by the noise when there is no voice activity.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Adjustable MasterPitch presets</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>MasterPitch</b> comes with the three presets, with options for lower/higher pitch and volume adjustment:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>MILD</b>: Delay: 40 ms, Pitch: +/-3 semitones, TrueVoice, Volume: 40%</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>MEDIUM</b>: Delay: 100 ms, Pitch: +/-6 semitones, TrueVoice, Volume: 40%</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>STRONG</b>: Delay: 250 ms, Pitch: +/-6 semitones, TrueVoice, Volume: 40%</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Due to microphone and hearphones characteristics, volume should be adjusted such that sound level is comfortable and the Altered FeedBack is more audible than the natural acoustic feedback.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>MasterPitch</b> is an application for the iPad and iPhone platforms.</p>
